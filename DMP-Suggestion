# 📌 Proposal: Enhance Personalization, Maintainability, and Support for the Platform

## 🧠 Context

Following Claudia's suggestions in the recent meeting regarding:

- **User-specific loading on the Try More page**, and
- **Future maintainability of the website**

I’d like to propose a combined upgrade to the platform that not only addresses these concerns directly, but also improves user experience, documentation structure, and community support in the long run.

## 🙋‍♂️ Background

As someone who has contributed the most to this project after Safwan, I’ve observed the challenges that come with:

- Lack of personalized user interaction
- Scattered or hard-to-navigate documentation
- Limited pathways for user engagement or support

## 🎯 Proposal Overview

### 1. 🔍 Search Functionality with Unified Documentation

Introduce a **site-wide search system** that can query through:

- Pages
- Documentation
- FAQs

#### Benefits:
- Greatly improves **usability** for contributors and users alike.
- Solves part of the **user-specific data issue** — users can now find content tailored to their needs.
- Forces a **structured and maintainable documentation system** that scales.

> 🔧 *If this project is taken up, the contributor will also need to rework the documentation system, ensuring long-term maintainability.*

### 2. 🤖 Role-Based Chatbot Assistant (LLM-Driven)

Implement a **conversational chatbot** trained on the documentation and FAQs. It will:

- Appear at the bottom corner of the screen.
- Start by asking:
  > "I am a..." → [Parent] [Student] [Working Professional] [Investor]
- Based on the selection, personalize the **Try More** page (reordered/filtered).
- Accept free-text queries like:
  > “What’s the best starting point for my 10-year-old?”

#### Benefits:
- Provides **personalized user interaction** without creating a separate Q&A page (avoids SEO issues).
- Enhances accessibility and **lowers the barrier to entry**.
- Makes use of existing and future documentation as training context.

### 3. 💳 Payment Gateway Integration for Donations

Add a **simple and accessible payment option** to enable micro-donations.

#### Benefits:
- Encourages more frequent, smaller contributions.
- Improves user support and platform sustainability.
- Supports long-term growth (e.g., funding internships, features, community efforts).

## 🔗 DMP Scope Suggestion

The **Search System + Chatbot** can be proposed as a **combined DMP project**:

- Common dependency: improved and unified documentation
- Common benefit: personalization, long-term scalability
- Allows the contributor to own a meaningful, high-impact feature
