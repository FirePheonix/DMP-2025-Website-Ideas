# ðŸ“Œ Proposal: Enhance Personalization, Maintainability, and Platform-Wide Contribution Experience

## Context

Following Claudia's suggestions in the recent meeting regarding:

## Conclusion

This proposal addresses Claudia's specific concerns about personalization and maintainability while setting the foundation for long-term platform sustainability. The features are designed to work both independently and as an integrated ecosystem, allowing for phased implementation based on priorities and resources.

I recommend starting with the Search and SEO features as they provide immediate value with moderate effort. React Flows integration should be prioritized as it directly enhances the core educational mission.
